We're going to practice downloading files from a web site.  We'll use this practice to download more lab materials!
==========
==========
8. Now let's try downloading a file from a web site.  Type in the URL *exactly* as is: google.com.

$ curl google.com

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">

Write the command you used to determine your directory.  Also, copy and paste the output below.
----------
pwd
/Users/dexter.manswell85/Desktop/my-stuff
==========
12. If you're not in your home directory, change to it (use the shortcut).

Write the command that you used to change to your home directory.  If you were already in your home directory, write the command that you *would* have used to change to it!
----------
cd ~


==========
13. So... the lab materials are located at this url:

http://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip

Download the file using curl... to a file called mtec1002-lab-02.zip using the commandline.  

REMEMBER to use the -o flag, and follow it with a .zip extension! 

Use ls to verify that it downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to download the file below.  Additionally, write the output of the command below.
----------
V217-M13:~ dexter.manswell85$ curl -o lab2.zip http://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

14. We learned a command to uncompress a .zip file.  Use it to extract the files and folders from the file you just downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to uncompress the file.
----------

unzip lab2.zip

==========
15. Change to the directory that was just created.  List the contents (of the directory that was extracted from the labs .zip file). 

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
books	logs	web


==========
We're going to mess around with archiving and compressing files.  We'll make a directory with a file in it... archive and compress it.... and uncompress it elsewhere.
==========
==========
16. Go back up to your home directory.  Create a directory called stuff.  List the contents of your home directory to prove that the directory was created.

Copy and paste the output below.
----------

Applications	Downloads	Music		__MACOSX	mtec1002-lab-02
Desktop		Library		Pictures	isus
Documents	Movies		Public		lab2.zip

==========
17. Change into the "stuff" directory that you just created.  Run the following command (we haven't learned this exact command yet, but we will in the next lab!) exactly as described below:

$ echo "hi" > hello.txt

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be stuff).  

Copy and paste the output below.
----------

food		google.txt	hello.txt

==========
18. Go up one directory back into your home directory.  Run the following commands exactly to create a compressed archive of the stuff folder.

$ tar -cvf stuff.tar stuff

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be home).  

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
V217-M13:Desktop dexter.manswell85$ tar -cvf stuff.tar my-stuff/
a my-stuff
a my-stuff/google.txt
a my-stuff/food
a my-stuff/hello.txt
V217-M13:Desktop dexter.manswell85$ ls
my-stuff	stuff.tar



==========
19. Go up one directory back into your home directory.  Run the following commands exactly to create a compressed archive of the stuff folder.

$ tar -cvf stuff.tar stuff

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
V217-M13:Desktop dexter.manswell85$ tar -cvf stuff.tar my-stuff/
a my-stuff
a my-stuff/google.txt
a my-stuff/food
a my-stuff/hello.txt
V217-M13:Desktop dexter.manswell85$ ls
my-stuff	stuff.tar


==========
20. List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be home).  

Copy and paste the output below. (It should contain stuff.tar)
----------

my-stuff	stuff.tar

==========
21. Now compress it!  Type:

gzip stuff.tar

List your files again.... you should have a new file with a .gz extension.  Copy and paste the output of your this below.
----------

my-stuff	stuff.tar.gz

==========
22. Move stuff.tar.gz into the lab directory that we downloaded.  We didn't learn this command yet, so just type in exactly as is:

$ mv stuff.tar.gz mtec1002-lab-02 

MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE FILE THAT ENDS IN .gz!

Change your directory to mtec1002-lab-02.  

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (stuff.tar.gz should be there).
----------

books		logs		stuff.tar.gz	web
==========
23. You should be in the lab directory.  Let's uncompress the file.

$ tar -xvf stuff.tar.gz

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (the folder, stuff, should be there).
----------

books		logs		my-stuff	stuff.tar.gz	web
